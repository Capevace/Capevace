I"<p>WordPress License Server enables you to supply automatic updates for the plugins you develop, while only allowing such features if the customer actually owns a license.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>You can either create and manage your own licenses or simply verify Envato Purchase Codes using the Envato API.
The Laravel application / PHP script is built for other theme/plugin developers, who want automatic updates and license/Envato purchase code verification for their own plugins. So if you want to implement such features into your plugin, this project is right for you!</p>
