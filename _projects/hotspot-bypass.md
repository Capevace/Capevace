HotspotBypass offers an easy way to change your MAC address on macOS. Get unlimited access to data-capped WiFi by randomizing your address everytime you run out of data or impersonate other network users and take theirs.

	However, bypassing WiFi restrictions might not be legal in every country. Remember to check before using.
