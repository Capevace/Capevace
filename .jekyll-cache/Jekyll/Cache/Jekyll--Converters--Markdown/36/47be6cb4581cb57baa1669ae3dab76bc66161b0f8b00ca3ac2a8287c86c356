I"`<p>Learning a new technology without building a real-world application is hard. Building a Hacker News client teaches you some of its most important aspects. They provide a great API, that makes it easy to get started with a UI-related project. <em>Also I just wanted my own Hacker News client but this sounds way cooler</em>.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Browse Hacker News posts (obviously, <em>duh</em>)</li>
  <li>Read &amp; browse through comments</li>
  <li>Bookmark your favourite posts</li>
  <li>That’s about it…</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="coming-soon">Coming soon</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Cache bookmarked posts for offline-reading</li>
  <li>iCloud Sync for bookmarks</li>
  <li>I’ll also try to implement some kind of way to post articles &amp; comments to HN, but there’s no official API for this so it might be a bit hacky…</li>
</ul>
