I"ú<p>When you start setting up software for your home â€“ be it home automation, a NAS system or something else â€“ youâ€™ll end up having a few different dashboards for control, that are all kind of ugly anyway. Thatâ€™s where Mission Control comes in. It is a beatutiful and easy-to-configure dashboard system for your home!</p>
