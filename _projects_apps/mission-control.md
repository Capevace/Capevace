When you start setting up software for your home – be it home automation, a NAS system or something else – you'll end up having a few different dashboards for control, that are all kind of ugly anyway. That's where Mission Control comes in. It is a beatutiful and easy-to-configure dashboard system for your home!

## Features

- Hook up smart home controls to your own devices
- Embeddable file browser, youtube downloader and Spotify player
- Sleek, customizable UI

### Planned

- Stability: while Mission Control works gracefully in my home, keep in mind that I've mostly built this for myself so not every use case will be stable at the moment
