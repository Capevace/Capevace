H.A.L.B.E.R.T. is an open-source home automation software made for the Raspberry Pi. It enables users to easily control things in their home using either a web interface, or just using their voice. It uses an easy-to-use module system, which enables more advanced users to develop their own tools, and integrate them. Actually, most of the internal tools are built using just that module system.
